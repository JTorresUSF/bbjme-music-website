                    <p>Q: Who are you?</p>
                    <p><b>A: I'm Jaime Torres Jr and I go by the alias of bbjme.</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Q: What's the reasoning behind your name and why is it spelled so weirdly?</p>
                    <p><b>A: I chose my name because my family used to call me 'baby Jaime' when I was
                            younger and that I was the youngest 'Jaime Torres' in the family. The stylization
                            is actually influenced in the way 'Baby No Money' spells his name - bbno$. I think
                            it's funny and cool to be honest.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Q: Who are your musical influences?
                    </p>
                    <p><b>A: When it comes to hip hop, r&b and soul, I'm influenced by Wu-Tang Clan,
                            J Cole, Kanye West, Nas, Lauryn Hill, Ne-Yo, Earth, Wind, and Fire and
                            so much more.
                            I also grew up listening to reggaeton, salsa, and bachata so Aventura,
                            Don Omar, Jerry Rivera, and Prince Royce are some artists that influenced me as well.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Q: Why did you choose hip hop and r&b in particular?</p>
                    <p><b>A: I chose hip hop because it tells the stories of how black and Latino people
                            overcome their struggles and the grind they put into the music.
                            It's awe-inspiring and it reminds me of where my family and I come
                            from and how proud we are. R&B is very soulful and calms me down whenver I'm
                            going through some shit. I've also developed an R&B voice over the years and I'm
                            really blessed to be able to sing well. Also wanna give a shoutout to St. Pete

                            artists
                            in the game currently.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Q: What else have you done outside of music?</p>
                    <p><b>A: I cofounded a startup called Zublease with my friends
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/william.darrigo/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">William D'Arrigo</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/senthuren12/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Senthuren Sivarupan</a>. Will came up with the idea to me
                            one night during a college party and I thought it was great, so I happily
                            partnered with him! Senthuren joined shortly after I did and we were able to release
                            iOS and Android apps in 2020. Another person named
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cremi.art/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Cremi Patel</a> came
                            along and helped tremendously with the marketing and design. Zublease is now defunct
                            unfortunately, but we learned a lot from this experience and I'm privileged to have
                            worked with all of them!</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Q: Any hobbies that you got?</p>
                    <p><b>A: I love watching anime, cartoons, and video games! My favorite
                            anime are Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate - I own the Blu-Ray discs of Cowboy
                            Bebop and the PS4 and PC versions of the Steins;Gate visual novel.
                            My favorite cartoon has to be
                            Ed, Edd N Eddy - so many laughs and memories are attached to that show for me!
                            As for my favorite video game, it has to be Metal Gear Solid for the Sony PlayStation.
                            It's the perfect game for me and it holds a large place in my heart!</b>
